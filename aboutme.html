    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>Hi!  Welcome to my portfolio.  I am so happy to share with you a little bit about myself and my work.  I have ten years of experience as a teacher, in which the first two were spent in Florida, and the remainder as an English as a New Language teacher at a public school in New York.  I have my Master's Degree and am very proud to have accomplished receiving a 4.0 GPA while working as the Graduate Assistant during my studies.  Teaching refugees and newcomers was one of the greatest professional challenges that I have had, but every moment of it was rewarding.  Their bright smiles and eagerness to learn was contagious and I was fortunate to have had these in my life.  Not only did I teach these students, but was taught a lot about language, culture, life and war in return.</p>
